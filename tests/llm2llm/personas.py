"""LLM-to-LLM personas for the Dialux SDR agent ("Linda", V7.9 slot-lock).

Personas are PER-AGENT, built from scratch against THIS agent (see
tests/llm2llm/README.md for the authoring rules). This set is the direct
port of the Retell-era battery (retell/tools/test_llm2llm.py, 13 personas)
— same narratives, same seeded dynvars, same expect flags — so a run against
the self-hosted LangGraph brain is directly comparable with a run against
the live Retell chat agent during migration (--transport retell).

Persona schema (your SOP template):
  name    display label incl. the expected outcome
  type    happy-path | mean | dumb | problematic | enquiry-only | ai-question | curve
  expect  "book" | "no-book"   (scored by harness.py)
  dynvars seeded dynamic variables (must exist in default_dynamic_variables
          of agent/llm.json — enforced by test_harness_units.py)
  opener  the caller's first line
  system  the caller-LLM system prompt (narrative + facts + rules)

Run order (SOP): happy first — stress/curve only after happy passes.
