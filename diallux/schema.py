"""Typed dynamic variables (V2 production iteration #1).

The Retell artifact stores 41 dynamic variables as a flat stringly dict — the
root cause of the null-dv bug class you built a whole verification tool for.
In V2 every variable is a typed field on a Pydantic model:

  - "" / None defaults instead of Retell's JSON null clobbering
  - booleans are real booleans (server-written gates can't be "null")
  - int fields coerce digit-strings ("20" -> 20) the way the leak tool needs
  - to_flat() feeds the verbatim {{dv}} substitution, so prompts don't change

SERVER_OWNED_DVS: keys that only webhook responses (or deterministic nodes)
may write. If the LLM tries to fill one via an extract tool, the write is
rejected — the model can no longer fabricate progress (slot_verified,
data_verified, phone_confirmed, booking_verified ...). This is what lets the
graph route on gate booleans safely.
